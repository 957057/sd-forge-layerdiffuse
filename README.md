This is a WIP extension for SD WebUI [(via Forge)](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge) to generate transparent images and layers.

The image generating and basic layer functionality is working now, but the transparent img2img is not finished yet (will finish in about one week).

This code base is highly dynamic and may change a lot in the next month. If you are from professional content creation studio and need all previous results to be strictly reproduced, you may consider backup files during each update.

# Before You Start

Because many people may be curious about how the latent preview looks like during a transparent diffusion process, I recorded a video so that you can see it before you download the models and extensions:

You can see that the native transparent diffusion can process transparent glass, semi-transparent glowing effects, etc, that are not possible with simple background removal methods. Native transparent diffusion also gives you detailed fur, hair, whiskers, and detailed structure like that skeleton.
